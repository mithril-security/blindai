## What should I know before I get started?

### I only have a question
If you have a question to ask or you want to open a discussion about BlindAI or confidential computing in general, we have a dedicated [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/TxEHagpWd4) in which all these kind of exchanges are more than welcome!

### BlindAI Project

BlindAI is a fast, easy to use and confidential inference server, allowing to deploy models that works on sensitive data. Thanks to the end-to-end protection guarantees, data owners can send private data to be analyzed by AI models, without fearing exposing their data to anyone else.

The solution has two parts:
- A secure inference solution to serve AI models with privacy guarantees (Built with **Rust**).
- A client SDK to securely consume the remote AI models (Built with **Python**).

You can find more information about the **Roadmap** of the project [here](https://blog.mithrilsecurity.io/our-roadmap-at-mithril-security/).

### Useful Resources

We highly encourage you to take a look at this resources for further information about BlindAI. 

It is also recommeneded to see the [examples](https://github.com/mithril-security/blindai/tree/master/examples) that demonstrate how BlindAI works before submitting your first contribution.

* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Linting and formatting

This repository uses the following:
- flake8 and black to lint/format python code.
- Cargo formatter to format Rust code.

### Pre-commit hook
To ensure the style guidelines are maintained in the codebase, **pre-commit hook** is used.

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in.

The labels are organised in 4 groups : `Info`, `Type`, `Status` and `priority`.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue has a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.
