# BlindAI API models
_________________________________

We're planning to make a number of **open-source models** easily accessible **with privacy guarantees**. 

## ✔️ Whisper
_______________________

Whisper is an open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web.

You can go check out our [Whisper](./whisper_tutorial.ipynb) tutorial to see how to already use the speech-to-text model with BlindAI API. 

## ⌛ OpenChatKit
______________________

OpenChatKit provides a powerful, open-source base to create both specialized and general purpose chatbots for various applications.

*Coming soon*
