# Setting up your dev environment

## Using remote container extension on Visual Studio Code üê≥

Clone the repo and open it in Visual Studio Code. If you do not have the remote container extension, Visual Studio Code should prompt you to install it. 

Open the green menu at the bottom-left of the Visual Studio Code.

Choose: "Open folder in container". It will build for you the image described in [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/mithril-security/blindai/blob/master/server/docker/build.dockerfile) with the dev-env target. It installs Ubuntu18-04 and all the dependencies and drivers the project needs as well as the Rust analyzer, python-intellisense and jupyter-notebook Visual Studio Code extensions.

To get started on the project you should create a python virtual environment like this :
```
virtualenv ~/python3.9-dev-env
source ~/python3.9-dev-env/bin/activate
```

Then you can install the python client SDK in editable mode with :
```
cd client
python setup.py install
pip install -e .
```

And try to build the server part, by following [this tutorial](build-from-sources/server.md#without-docker).

## Without Docker

If you don't want to use docker, you will need to install the following:

* Intel SGX DCAP **1.41** Driver
* Intel SGX SDK v2.15.1
* Intel SGX PSW (version 2.15.101.1 for the PSW librairies and 1.12.101.1 for the PSW-DCAP librairies)
* Rust nightly-2021-11-01 with Xargo

You can find the [installation guides](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.9/docs/) for Intel SGX software on the 01.org website.

Note: if you are running on a machine without SGX support, you will need the simulation versions of the Intel PSW and SDK.
